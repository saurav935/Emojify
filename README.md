Emojis or avatars are ways to indicate nonverbal cues. These cues have become an essential part of online chatting, product review, brand emotion, and many more. It also lead to increasing data science research dedicated to emoji-driven storytelling.

With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it is now possible to detect human emotions from images. In this deep learning project, I have classified human facial expressions to filter and map corresponding emojis or avatars.

# About the Dataset
The FER2013 dataset ( facial expression recognition) consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale images. The images are centered and occupy an equal amount of space. This dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:

- 0:angry
- 1:disgust
- 2:fear
- 3:happy
- 4:sad
- 5:surprise
- 6:neutral

# Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN
In this deep learning project, I have built a convolution neural netwirk to recognize facial emotions. I have trained the model on the FER-2013 dataset. Then, I have mapped those emotions with the corresponding emojis/avatars.
